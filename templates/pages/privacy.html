      are popular and count visits. We may also collect information using web

      derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law
      as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For
      example, we may aggregate your Technical Data to calculate the percentage
      of users accessing a specific website feature. However, if we combine or
      connect aggregated data with your personal data so that it can directly or

      data sub-processors to perform various functions. A list of sub-processors

    We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal
    data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way,
    altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to
    those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a
    business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our
    instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. We have put
    in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will
    notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally
    required to do so.
  </p>
  <h3>Data Retention</h3>
  <p>
    We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil
    the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying
    any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine the
    appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount,
    nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm
    from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for
    which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those
    purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. In some
    circumstances we may fully anonymize your personal data (so that it can no
    longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which
    case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
  </p>
  <h3>Social Sharing Features</h3>
  <p>
    Our Services may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools
    (such as the Facebook "Like" button), which let you share actions you take
    on our Services with other media, and vice versa. The use of such features
    enables the sharing of information with your friends or the public,
    depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the
    social sharing feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of
    data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features,
    please visit the privacy policies of the entities that provide these
    features.

    entities may use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect
    information about your use of our Services and other websites, including
    your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links
    clicked and conversion information. This information may be used by Compute

  </p>
  <h3>Access, Erasure and Correction</h3>
  <p>
    The laws in the European Economic Area and certain jurisdictions outside the
    United States, require us to provide users (to the extent those laws apply

    information below. We will permit you to correct, amend, or delete
    information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate. We will respond to your
    request within a reasonable timeframe. Please note, because of the way we
    maintain certain services, after you delete or amend your information,
    residual copies may take a period of time before they are deleted from our
    active servers and may remain in our backup systems. You will need to
    provide sufficient identifying information, such as your name and email
    address and possible additional identifying information as a security
    precaution.

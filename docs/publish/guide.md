# Publishing on Compute Studio

There are two ways to publish an app on Compute Studio. **Data visualizations** are built on top of hosting software like Bokeh. **Models** are built on top of ParamTools and are good for archiving results and computational processes that take a long time to run.

## 1. Publish a data visualization.

C/S can host Bokeh and Dash visualizations and plans to add more data-viz software like RStudio and Streamlit. Check out the data viz docs to get started.

## 2. Publish a model.

C/S uses ParamTools to host compuational models where model runs can take anywhere from a few seconds to days. Checkout the model docs to get started.

      Are you sure that you would like to delete your account? This will delete all of your data,
      including the outputs of all of your simulations. There are less drastic options available
      such as <a href="{% url 'cancel_subscription' %}">canceling your subscription</a> without
      deleting your data.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have a minute, we'd really appreciate an
      <a href="mailto:admin@compute.studio">email</a> from you telling us how we can make Compute
      Studio a better site and win you back in the future.
